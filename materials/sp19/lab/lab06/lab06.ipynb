In the control group the subjects will talk to the experimenter using the neutral therapy questions. The experimental group will place there hands through a hole in the divider and hold hands with the experimenter. They will also be asked the questions. Both groups will answer a set of baseline questions with scales from 1-10 and after the experiment, they will answer follow-up questions to see if there is significance. Repetition of this experiment will ensure reliable averages. If 70% or above of the participants show improvement through TT, then there is significance in TT."

    "Therapeutic touch fell out of use after this experiment, which was eventually accepted into one of the premier medical journals. TT practitioners hit back and accused Emily and her family of tampering with the results, while some claimed that Emily's bad spiritual mood towards therapeutic touch made it difficult to read her HEF. Whatever it may be, Emily's experiment is a classic example about how anyone, with the right resources, can test anything they want!\n",

    "1. Do we reject Emily's hypothesis, or fail to reject it? \n",
